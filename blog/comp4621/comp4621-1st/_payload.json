You can make the colors contrasting very well, that will make the whole app ery intuitive to the users because they know the elements are different things from the fact that they have different colors. But, that will destroy whole balance in color scheme, aesthetics area of the app will be ruined. On the other hand, using coherance, paired color is good, but it is not so inituitive to users, or epressing our intended idea by that color&shape. So in this case, different shapes are needed to indicate the elements are different.

I know how to balance my own idea in the functionalities of the app, with our teammates, after working with them.

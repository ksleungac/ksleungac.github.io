## Abstract

This is a project from *[COMP4211 (Machine Learning)](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/IMCE/UG/Course%20Syllabus/Fall_2021-2022/COMP4211_Fall%2021-22.pdf)* Course in HKUST. I studies 2 CNN models used in ILSVRC including AlexNet and VGGnet on the *[Industrial Biscuits dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imonbilk/industry-biscuit-cookie-dataset)*. I then implemented a 'scale-down' version of the VGGnet named 'VGGlite' to fit the task that I was doing.  

This project was submitted in the Spring Semester in the year 2023. (around May).

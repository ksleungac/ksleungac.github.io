It will be a perfect scenario where language-learners can get themseleves into the atmosphere. Later we also decide to boarden the the scope a bit. Make it tourist/museum like theme. And because of this is a international theme, we just want to put international famous heritage around the world, and in the centre it will be a flat piazza for people to gather and chat. It also acts as a centre point for us.

Until now, I get to know that, spoke generates collision and walkable planes using two different techniques. Normally the walking plane is generated using trimesh. Trimesh provides a high definition walking plane, And user can walk up slope, uneven terrain. So every plane are made of triangles. However, although this method works fine in small indoor map. For such a big complex outdoor terrain map, it is too complicated for spoke to generate such terrain. and often it will throw out error such as 'error generating nav mesh'. And we always find it hard to upload onto mozilla hub.",{"type":18,"tag":27,"props":69,"children":70},{},[71],{"type":24,"value":72},"You can see the 'force trimesh' box in this picture.

So it can only create planes that are different height. mostly slopes are ignored. So the user can't walk on terrain. And it is very confusing to have somewhere you can't walk. It't like meeting a airwall in a game. c You can see the floor plan meseed up on slopes, and for stonhenge it's another mess. It means that the user can'walk inside the stonhenge, and walk up the slope.",{"type":18,"tag":27,"props":79,"children":80},{},[81],{"type":24,"value":82},"So at the end, we settled on the default terrain map, we added a flat plane on it, so it would be flat. And we can place objects on it without making to much of adjustment to the objects. This is the end product that ends up in the demo video. The grey flat plane is what I mentioned. And we added objects to the plane. Moreover, clouds like sphere were also added. Also the 'simple' water object was placed to make the titanic looks like sinking into the water. You may already figured out. We want to make a scene in the Titanic film. And it would be fun to get a feeling of standing at the end of the ship, to feel what that height feels.",{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":84,"children":86},{"id":85},"models-processing",[87],{"type":24,"value":88},"Models - Processing",{"type":18,"tag":27,"props":90,"children":91},{},[92],{"type":24,"value":93},"We took some models on Sketchfab to be our heritage objects. But there are some models that are either hand-made or scanned using photogrammerty. We had a Fumishimi Castle in our map, which that model was originally scanned into a 3D object. The original model is even larger than this, it is as if it's the whole scenery in there. But we need to trim it down as a smaller object. The reason is, a small history lesson first. The japanese castle were designed so high, and have a base that are multi stories is that, they can be higher when someone trys to attack the castle. But it means that the floor plan generation and collision handling will be very hard for us.

That sounds interesting, And relatively easy to implement, also fits our culture exchange theme. I searched some local games on web. And these traditional games are all mainly boardgames, so it's really easy to implement. and we use duck+chicken to be our chess. The fron two games are Kaooa from India and another strategy game from South Korea. The 3 games behind that are 3 different three in a row games from 3 different countries.

I get the idea from a discontinued programme by TVB. It's called the Earth Live (瞬間看地球), and it has been discontinued in the April the 1st. It's really sad lo...\r\nThe programme is just a live camera around the world. But I think that is a small part of collective memories of Hong Kong. So I want to mimic the programme, by using the same UIs and Musics from it. You can see I photoshoped the UI into the video. And that UI acted as a title also for each part of the demo. In the demo I introduced and demo-ed many concepts in thie world, such as timetable feture, it's like, I don't know someone who's reading this have played GTAv before, on the online server, there will be random event every 5-10 minutes or so. And player will be motivated to paticipate in such event, so the online game play will be more interesting. It is the same idea in our world, but a little different. Just the events are talks/shars/tours/games, they are more 'educational' I would say. Because if you get into the world without anything todo, it would be rather boring.

To be honest, I personally think the whole map can be better, as well as the lighting. I asked a friend which I do needfinding and surverying about the final product, he's also the guy who gives me initial idea on making a tourists spot map first. He said the map looks like a 3D game from the early 2000s. Where I can't agreed anymore. Because I later realized the lighting in mozilla hub is really for indoor lighting.

Think if you are a user, why would I use this instead of discord? Same goes for the games idea, why won't I just play human fall flat? Why I don't just play animal crossing or other sports games?

Not to mention We have a souvenir feature, which allows players to exchange souvenirs that are a icon of its country with others!
